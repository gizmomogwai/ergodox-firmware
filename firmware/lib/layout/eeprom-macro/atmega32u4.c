 * Implements the eeprom-macro functionality defined in "../eeprom-macro.h" for
 * the ATMega32U4
 *
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * - The default state (the "erased" state) of this EEPROM is all `1`s, which
 *   makes setting a byte to `0xFF` easier and faster in hardware than zeroing
 *   it (and also causes less wear on the memory over time, I think).  This is
 *   reflected in some of our choices for default values, and such.
 *
 * - GCC and AVR processors (and Intel processors, for that matter) are
 *   primarily little endian: in avr-gcc, multi-byte data types are allocated
 *   with the least significant byte occupying the lowest address.  Protocols,
 *   data formats (including UTF-8), and such are primarily big endian.  I like
 *   little endianness better -- it just feels nicer to me -- but after writing
 *   a bit of code, it seems that big endian serializations are easier to work
 *   with, at least in C.  For that reason, this code organizes bytes in a big
 *   endian manner whenever it has a choice between the two.
 *
 * - For a long time, I was going to try to make this library robust in the
 *   event of power loss, but in the end I decided not to.  This feature is
 *   meant to be used for *temporary* macros - so, with the risk of power loss
 *   during a critical time being fairly low, and the consequence of (detected)
 *   data corruption hopefully more of an annoyance than anything else, I
 *   decided the effort (and extra EEMEM usage) wasn't worth it.

 * To define the layout of our section of the EEPROM
 *
 * Members:
 * - `EEMEM_START`: The address of the first byte of our block of EEMEM
 * - `EEMEM_START_ADDRESS_START`
 * - `EEMEM_START_ADDRESS_END`
 * - `EEMEM_END_ADDRESS_START`

 * - `EEMEM_MACROS_START`
 * - `EEMEM_MACROS_END`
 * - `EEMEM_END`: The address of the last byte of our block of EEMEM
 *
 *
 * EEMEM sections:
 *
 * - START_ADDRESS:
 *     - byte 0: MSB of `EEMEM_START`
 *     - byte 1: LSB of `EEMEM_START`
 *
 * - END_ADDRESS:
 *     - byte 0: MSB of `EEMEM_END`
 *     - byte 1: LSB of `EEMEM_END`
 *
 * - VERSION:
 *     - byte 0:
 *         - This byte will all be set to `VERSION` as the last step of
 *           initializing our portion of the EEPROM.
 *         - Upon initialization, if this value is not equal to the current
 *           `VERSION`, our portion of the EEPROM should be reinitialized.
 *
 * - MACROS: byte 0..`(EEMEM_END - EEMEM_VERSION_END - 1)`:
 *     - This section will contain a series of zero or more macros, each with
 *       the following format:
 *         - byte 0: `type == TYPE_DELETED`
 *             - byte 1: `length`: the total number of bytes used by this
 *               macro, including the bytes for `type` and `length`
 *             - byte 2...: (optional) undefined
 *         - byte 0: `type == TYPE_VALID_MACRO`
 *             - byte 1: `length`: the total number of bytes used by this
 *               macro, including the bytes for `type` and `length`
 *             - byte 2...: (variable length, as described below)
 *                 - `key-action` 0: the key-action which this macro remaps
 *             - byte ...: (optional) (variable length, as described below)
 *                 - `key-action` 1...: the key-actions to which `key-action` 0
 *                   is remapped
 *         - byte 0: `type == TYPE_END`
 *             - byte 1...: (optional) undefined
 *
 *     - The last key-action in this series will have `type == TYPE_END`.
 *
 *     - A key-action is a variable length encoding of the information in a
 *       `key_action_t`, with the following format:
 *
 *           byte 0
 *           .----------------------------------------------.
 *           |     7     |    6    | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0  |
 *           |----------------------------------------------|
 *           | continued | pressed | layer |  row  | column |
 *           '----------------------------------------------'
 *
 *           byte 1..3 (optional)
 *           .----------------------------------------------.
 *           |     7     |    6    | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0  |
 *           |----------------------------------------------|
 *           | continued |    1    | layer |  row  | column |
 *           '----------------------------------------------'
 *
 *         - `continued`:
 *             - `1`: The next byte is part of this key-action
 *             - `0`: The next byte is not part of this key-action (i.e. this
 *                    is the last byte in this key-action)
 *
 *         - `pressed`:
 *             - This value is stored *only* in the first byte.  In all
 *               subsequent bytes the bit should be set to `1`.
 *
 *         - `layer`, `row`, `column`:
 *             - In the first byte of this key-action, these fields contain the
 *               two most significant bits of their respective values such that
 *               these bits are nonzero in *any* of `layer`, `row`, or
 *               `column`.  In subsequent bytes of this key-action, these
 *               fields contain the pair of bits to the right of the pair of
 *               bits in the previous key-action byte (the next less
 *               significant pair of bits).  If `layer`, `row`, and `column`
 *               all equal `0`, then these three fields will all equal `0`, and
 *               there will only be 1 byte written for this key-action.
 *
 *         - Example of an encoded key-action:
 *
 *               --- as a key_action_t ---
 *               pressed = false
 *               layer   = 0 b 00 00 01 00
 *               row     = 0 b 00 01 10 01
 *               column  = 0 b 00 10 00 11
 *                             |        '- least significant pair of bits
 *                             '- most significant pair of bits
 *
 *               --- in EEMEM ---
 *               byte 0 = 0 b 1 0 00 01 10
 *               byte 1 = 0 b 1 1 01 10 00
 *               byte 2 = 0 b 0 1 00 01 11
 *                            | | |  |  '- column bit pair
 *                            | | |  '- row bit pair
 *                            | | '- layer bit pair
 *                            | '- pressed / 1
 *                            '- continued
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 * - `START_ADDRESS` and `END_ADDRESS` are written as part of our effort to
 *   make sure that the assumptions in place when writing the data don't shift
 *   (undetected) by the time it gets read.  Either of these values could
 *   change, legitimately, without `VERSION` being incremented, but it's
 *   important that any two builds of the firmware that deal with this section
 *   of the EEPROM have the same values for each.

// TODO:
//
// - i was thinking before that the calling function need not ignore layer
//   shift keys, or any other keys.  now i think that layer keys (or at least
//   layer shift keys) really should be ignored.  not doing so may lead to all
//   sorts of fun problems.  for example, if the "begin/end recording" key is
//   not on layer 0 (which it probably won't be), the last keys pressed (but
//   not released) will most likely be layer shift keys -- but since these keys
//   were not released before we stopped recording, there would be no record of
//   their release, and the macro would therefore push that layer onto the
//   layer stack, and never pop it off.
//
// - 255 bytes (so, on average, about 100 keystrokes = 200 key actions) should
//   be enough for a macro, i think.  `length` can be 1 byte, and count the
//   total number of bytes (including `type` and `length`, and anything else)
//
// - need to write something like:
//     - `kb__layout__exec_key_layer()`
//         - `kb__layout__exec_key()` could just look up the current layer
//           (falling through for transparent keys), and then call
//           `kb__layout__exec_key_layer()`.  this would obviate the need for a
//           separate `static get_layer(void)` function, since the
//           functionality would essentially be separated out anyway.
//     - `kb__led__delay__error()`
//         - "delay" because it should probably flash a few times, or
//           something, and i feel like it'd be better overall to not continue
//           accepting input while that's happening.
//
// - how should we handle key-functions, in both their SRAM and EEMEM forms?
//   it would be very convenient if we could compare the passed key-function
//   with EEMEM key-functions without having to decode the EEMEM ones (only
//   read them out - and maybe not even read out them out entirely).  perhaps
//   there should be different functions for converting from a `uint8_t a[4]`
//   to a `key_action_t`, and vice versa.  or perhaps `key_action_t`s should
//   really be `uint8_t a[4]`s, with a different encoding than those
//   representing EEMEM key-actions (which would be written to EEMEM eliding
//   zero bytes).  need to think about it some more.
